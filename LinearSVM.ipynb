I am not sure when this phone is will get busted due to this heating issue. It is definitely a challenge to hold this phone for even 1 minute. The heat that the phone is causing will definitely burn your hands and for man if you keep this phone in your pant pocket easily this will lead to infertility for you. Kindly please be aware about that.\n",
    "Issue 3:\n",
    "Even some unknown brands has a better touch sensitivity. The touch sensitivity is pathetic, if perform some operation it will easily take 1-2 minutes for the phone to response.\n",
    "For your kind information my system has 73% of Memory free and the RAM is also 56% free.\n",
    "Kindly please make this Review famous and lets make everyone aware of this issue with this phone.\n",
    "Let's save people from buying this phone. There are people who don't even know what to do if this issue happens after 10 days from the date of purchase. So I feel at least this review will help people from purchasing this product in mere future.\"\"\"\n",
